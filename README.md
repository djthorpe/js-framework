# js-framework

This Javascript framework is a pretty traditional Model, View and Controller
implementation which provides the following classes:

  * __Controller class__: Subclass this and hook your views and provider events together;
  * __Provider class__: To be used to request JSON objects and arrays of objects from an external source;
  * __Model class__: subclass this for your JSON models, and separately define the members of your class;
  * __View classes__: classes are provided for form, list, button, etc.
